- ***You*** are in charge of the content in the documents this tool creates. Always check and fix your drafts.

- Remember, skilled professionals will be checking your work. If you submit without changes, it ***will*** be rejected.
- ***Don't forget***, this tool doesn't have a "save" button. Your work is saved only in the word document you can download after filling out the form. If you leave or refresh the page, your work will be lost.
