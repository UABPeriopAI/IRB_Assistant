Participants were randomized into two groups, with one group receiving the experimental drug, while the other group was administered a placebo. Primary endpoints of the study included overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The drug demonstrated an increased median survival, and side effects were minor and transient, indicating the potential therapeutic value of the drug in clinical applications. However, a comprehensive interpretation of these results necessitates further investigation, particularly to determine the long-term effects of the treatment and its efficacy in a larger, more diverse population.
