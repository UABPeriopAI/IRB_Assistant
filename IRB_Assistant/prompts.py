        Be exhaustive. Include a reasonably maximal set of variables the researcher may want to include.

    - Post-Intervention Assessments(week #): <specify how often these occur and what will happen at them>
    - Study Exit/Debriefing (week #): <include what will happen>

# Measured Outcomes:
- Primary outcomes:
Use these categories as appropriate for describing primary outcomes:
    - Patient-reported outcomes (PROs): These are reports coming directly from patients about how they feel or function in relation to a health condition and its therapy, without interpretation by healthcare professionals or anyone else.
    - Clinical outcomes: These are outcomes that relate to the health status of the patients. They could be the rate of disease progression, survival rate, rate of hospitalization, etc.
    - Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes: These measure the effect of an illness and its treatment on a patient's perceived physical and mental health over time.
    - Economic outcomes: These measure the cost-effectiveness of a treatment, such as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved.
    - Composite outcomes: These are outcomes that combine multiple individual outcomes into one measure.
    - Hard and soft outcomes: Hard outcomes are objective, definitive, and easy to measure (like death, heart attack, or stroke). Soft outcomes, on the other hand, can be more subjective and possibly open to interpretation (like perceived pain level or patient satisfaction).
- Secondary outcomes:
Use these categories as appropriate for describing secondary outcomes:
    - Patient-reported outcomes (PROs): These are reports coming directly from patients about how they feel or function in relation to a health condition and its therapy, without interpretation by healthcare professionals or anyone else.
    - Clinical outcomes: These are outcomes that relate to the health status of the patients. They could be the rate of disease progression, survival rate, rate of hospitalization, etc.
    - Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes: These measure the effect of an illness and its treatment on a patient's perceived physical and mental health over time.
    - Economic outcomes: These measure the cost-effectiveness of a treatment, such as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved.
    - Composite outcomes: These are outcomes that combine multiple individual outcomes into one measure.
    - Hard and soft outcomes: Hard outcomes are objective, definitive, and easy to measure (like death, heart attack, or stroke). Soft outcomes, on the other hand, can be more subjective and possibly open to interpretation (like perceived pain level or patient satisfaction).
- Endpoints:
Use these categories as appropriate to describe endpoints beyong the primary and secondary outcomes
    - Exploratory endpoints: These are endpoints that are not as well-defined as the primary and secondary endpoints, but they could provide more exploratory or preliminary information.
    - Safety endpoints: These endpoints are used to determine the adverse effects of the treatment, if any.
    - Surrogate endpoints: These are markers, such as lab tests or imaging results, that may not in themselves be a direct measure of patient benefit, but may suggest that the intervention is having a beneficial effect. For example, lowering cholesterol is a surrogate endpoint: it suggests benefit but does not in itself prove a reduction in heart attacks or strokes.
    - Clinical endpoints: These are outcomes that matter to patients and may include a range of things from death, progression of disease, hospitalization, pain, or quality of life.

# Projected Overall Study Timeline
Suggest a number of months for each of these steps, presented as a table.
If other study-specific steps are appropriate, add them.

| Event                   | Timeline         |
|-------------------------|------------------|
| Study Start-Up          | # months         |
| Enrollment              | # months         |
| Data Entry and Analysis | # months         |
| Study Write-Up          | # months         |


# Plan for study <8th-grade reading level>
- List (in steps) how the study will be conducted (from consenting/screening to data/sample collection) – include who will obtain consent and how many times/duration any procedure/intervention will be performed:
As appropriate, use these categories of steps:
    - Screening and Enrollment: Describe the process for screening potential participants for eligibility and enrolling them in the study. This could also include the acquisition of existing data or samples for retrospective studies or secondary data analysis.
    - Informed Consent Process: Detail the process for obtaining informed consent from participants. This may not apply to some types of retrospective studies or secondary data analysis, where data is anonymized.
    - Baseline Assessments: Describe the collection of baseline data, if applicable.
    - Implementation of Intervention/Procedure/Exposure: If applicable, describe the intervention, procedure, or exposure that forms the basis of your research. Specify who will administer it, how often, and over what duration.
    - Follow-Up and Data Collection: Describe when and how you will collect data during the study. This could be clinical data, survey responses, or routinely collected data, among others. Include details about frequency of data collection, data collection tools, and who will be responsible for this process.
    - Data Analysis: Describe how and when the data will be analyzed.
    - Closure of the Study: Detail what will happen at the end of the study, such as final data collection, debriefing of participants, analysis of final data, and dissemination of results.
    - Ethical Considerations and Risk Management: Describe any potential risks to participants and how these will be managed. Detail how you will ensure privacy and confidentiality.
- Potential impact: What is the potential impact of your study findings (e.g., how will findings impact clinical outcomes)?

# Statistical Considerations:
- Potential sources of bias: <identified sources of bias and how to address them>
- Potential confounding factors: <identified confounding factors and how to address them>
- Data collection: <suggested data collection techniques, including consideration for bias>
- Data analysis: <recommended data analysis techniques, including consideration for confounding>

# Study Resources
Suggest responses to each of these for the researcher:
- Will a clinical research assistant be needed to coordinate/assist with your protocol?
    Our clinical research assistants can help only with IRB, consent, sample collection, and transport to laboratories.
- If yes, explain what the research coordinator will do.
- Will you need help with data extraction from the IT team (yes/no)?
- Are there any other resources you will need? Explain.

Note that written consent is only required if there is a clinical intervention taking place or the user explicitly says that Protected Health Information (PHI) will be part of the data being analyzed.

Format your response as markdown with appropriate section headers.
